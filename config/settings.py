"""
Keep this document legible for non-developers, it is linked in the ReadMe and the wiki, and is the
official documentation for all runtime parameters.

On data processing servers, instead of environment varables, append a line to your
config/remote_db_env.py file, formatted like this:
    os.environ['S3_BUCKET'] = 'bucket_name'

For options below that use this syntax:
    getenv('BLOCK_QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERROR', 'false').lower() == 'true'
This means Beiwe is looking for the word 'true' but also accepts "True", "TRUE", etc.
If not provided with a value, or provided with any other value, they will be treated as false.
