# Global:
#   study_folder
#   output_folder
#   tz_str  // tz_str is inserted based on the study's timezone.
#   time_start*
#   time_end*
# Time start and end are odd, they take a decomposed list of a datetime object's components, which
# we have converter for in libs.utils.date_utils - datetime_to_list. This is a hangover from when
# we were jsonifying the parameters.
#   Except for Sycamore doesn't. It just takes a YYYY-MM-DD string.
#     And also they are named start_date and end_date.
#   Code for all of this is in forest models.
