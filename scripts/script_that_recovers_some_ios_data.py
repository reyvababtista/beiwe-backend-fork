# This script will process all the files in the PROBLEM_UPLOADS folder of AWS S3, which contains all
# uploaded files that we were unable to decrypt. The existence of these files was due to a bug
# limited to iOS devices only. There was a race-condition that affected all .csv files and it could
# result in encryption keys failing to be present in uploaded files.
#
# 1) Sometimes the files were just junk, binary noise. I don't know when it was squashed, but it
#    was. These files are completely unparseable and are never expected to be recovered.
#
# 2) Sometimes the encryption key was not present - but two files with the same name, only one
#    containing the key, were uploaded. We added a capability to the backend to stash all decryption
#    keys in the database associated with those file names. We could then use them to decrypt files
#    lacking keys but matching the name. This required both an at-upload-time check and a periodic
#    script that checks the recently uploaded bad files and check for any keys. Code for this can be
#    found in /scripts/process_ios_no_decryption_key.py. The task for this script runs hourly.
#
# 3) Sometimes, and only observed as present in 2024 (after substantially rewriting iOS file-writing
#    code + thorough testing) the encryption key WAS present _but on the wrong line in the file_.
#    These files are fully recoverable, as are any instances of 2) that lost their keys to these
#    malformatted files.
####################################################################################################
#
# THIS SCRIPT...
# - Finds, decrypts, and sets up for processing all files affected by issue 3.
#
# - RE-processes all uploaded files that experienced issue 2.
#   - This is incredibly wasteful.
#   - This is because I can't work out how to determine if any given file has been processed at an
#     unknown time in the past.
#   - we could look at the created_on timestamp of the decryption key and make a heuristic guess???
#
# - Has been written with the intention of removing the architecture over in
#   /scripts/process_ios_no_decryption_key.py because We Have Fixed The Bug.
# 
# - Iterates over So Many Files that we can't even cache file names in memory.
#
# - At this point I'm considering making it a distributed celery task.
#
# - IS NOT FINISHED. I have been working on it on our staging server, its just so complex and gross.
#
# - Should probably delete the files in PROBLEM_UPLOADS after we are definitely completely done
#   processing them.
#
# - I don't know what the payoff actually is for this. It "seems like a lot" to me watching test
#   versions of the script execute on staging, but I would be astonished if it is 10%.
#   More data more better though, so its worth doing.
