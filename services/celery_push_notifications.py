    """
    Participants upload a list of uuids of their received notifications, these uuids are stashed in
    SurveyNotificationReport, are sourced from ScheduledEvents, and recorded on ArchivedEvents.
    
    Complex details about how to manipulate ScheduledEvents and ArchivedEvents correctly:
    
    - Archives from before this feature existed do not have the uuid field populated, this is our
      first exclusion criteria
    - This code does not create scheduled events, instead reactivates old ScheduledEvents by uuid.
    - If ScheduledEvents get recalculated we do lose that uuid, and would get stuck in a loop trying
      to find the matching ScheduledEvent by uuid from an old ArchivedEvent. We solve that by
      identifying these non-match-uuids and clearing the uuid field. This will fully retire the
      ArchivedEvent from the resend logic because we exclude those to start with.
    - This may cause a theoretical problem of being unable to identify the ArchivedEvent that a
      received SurveyNotificationReport maps to, but I don't think we care about that.
    - Note that this will create a "new" ScheduledEvent "in the past", forcing a send on the next
      push notification task, bypassing our time-gating logic from the ArchivedEvent's last_updated
      field.
    
    Other Details:
    
    - To inject a "no more than one resend every 30 minutes" we need to add a filtering by last
      updated time ArchivedEvent query, and "touch" all modified archive events when we check them.
    - We have to do an app version check for when uuid-reporting was added this feature, that may e
      subject to change and must be documented.
    - Only participants with an app version that passes the version check will create ArchivedEvents
      with uuids, so only push notifications to known-capable devices will activate resends.
